        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
            A spoonful of this Indian butter chicken with warm basmati rice may just be one of the best
            chicken recipes you’ll ever have. Juicy chicken thighs are marinated in a delicious spiced yogurt
            blend. But the real MVP here is this rich and creamy curry sauce – it’s ridiculously good.

            <li>½ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cumin</li>
            <li>¼ cup raw cashews</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon coconut sugar (or other sweetener)</li>
            <li>1 (15-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter (or ghee)</li>
            <li>½ cup heavy cream (or coconut cream)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For serving</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Basmatic rice</li>
            <li>Freshly chopped cilantro</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice the chicken. Cut the chicken into 1-inch pieces and place it in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Marinate the chicken. Add the yogurt, lemon juice, ginger, garlic, red chili powder, garam masala, turmeric, and salt to the bowl.
            Stir it all together, then cover and refrigerate for an hour (or up to overnight).</li>
            <li>Cook the chicken. Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a large saute pan. Place the marinated chicken in the fry pan and
            cook for 5 to 6 minutes, until the chicken is opaque. Transfer the chicken to a separate bowl.</li>
            <li>Make the sauce. Add the onions to the pan and saute for 3 to 4 minutes, until softened and translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the ginger, garlic, red chili powder, garam masala, coriander, cumin, and stir for another minute. Then add the cashews, crushed
            tomatoes, sugar, and water. Stir it all together, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the sauce to a high-powered blender and blend for a minute, until smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Combine it all together. Wipe the pan clean with a paper towel (if you'd like to remove any lumps from the
            final sauce), then stir together the creamy butter sauce, butter, and heavy cream.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken back to the pan over medium heat and stir with the sauce for 3 to 5 minutes, until the chicken is warmed and cooked through.</li>
            <li>To serve. Enjoy the butter chicken on it's own, or serve it over basmati rice topped with fresh cilantro.</li>
        </ol>
